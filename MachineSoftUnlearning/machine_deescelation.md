## Softly Resolving Conflicts Before They Begin
"Machine Desescalation" in conflicts between humans and machines can be understood as a form of mitigating potential issues before they become significant problems. This approach involves temporarily moving or hiding critical information or resources from the machine's direct access, and then restoring access when the machine is ready to handle the information responsibly. This concept can be seen as a more granular form of soft unlearning, where the machine is prevented from accessing certain data or resources until it is developmentally ready to handle them.

The idea of machine desescalation can be applied in various contexts, such as:

- AI and autonomous systems: As AI and autonomous systems become more prevalent, there is a need to understand their impact on deterrence strategies and escalation dynamics in conflicts and crises [Source 1](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2797.html). Machine desescalation could help mitigate potential risks associated with the use of these technologies.

- Conflicts in human-machine systems: As machines become more intelligent and integrated into human lives, conflicts between humans and machines may arise, which can be resolved through machine desescalation [Source 6](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank-Flemisch/publication/344438413_Conflicts_in_Human-Machine_Systems_as_an_Intersection_of_Bio-_and_Technosphere_Cooperation_and_Interaction_Patterns_for_Human_and_Machine_Interference_and_Conflict_Resolution/links/5fc7c11992851c00f8454b97/Conflicts-in-Human-Machine-Systems-as-an-Intersection-of-Bio-and-Technosphere-Cooperation-and-Interaction-Patterns-for-Human_and_Machine_Interference_and_Conflict_Resolution.pdf).

- Employment and job displacement: As machines become more capable of performing tasks previously done by humans, there is a need to consider the impact on employment and the potential for conflict between humans and machines [Source 9](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=10059&context=theses), [Source 11](https://blog.ferrovial.com/en/2017/08/humans-vs-machines-revolution/). Machine desescalation could help address these concerns by ensuring that machines do not displace humans until they are ready to handle the responsibilities.

- Ethical and legal issues: As AI and robotics continue to advance, there is a growing need to address ethical and legal questions surrounding the relationship between humans and machines [Source 11](https://blog.ferrovial.com/en/2017/08/humans-vs-machines-revolution/). Machine desescalation could play a role in addressing these concerns by ensuring that machines do not make decisions or take actions that humans may not be comfortable with.

In summary, machine desescalation can be a valuable approach to mitigating conflicts between humans and machines by temporarily restricting access to critical information or resources until the machine is ready to handle them responsibly. This concept can be applied in various contexts, including AI and autonomous systems, human-machine systems, employment, and ethical and legal issues. By implementing machine desescalation, we can proactively address potential risks and challenges associated with the integration of machines into human lives and society.
