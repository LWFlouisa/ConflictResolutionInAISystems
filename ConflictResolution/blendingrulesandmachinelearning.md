When blending rule-based systems, implied programming, and machine learning, there are several approaches to consider. The choice of approach depends on factors such as the complexity of the task, the volume of data, and the desired level of adaptability.

One approach is to combine rule-based systems with machine learning to improve performance in specific tasks. For example, a study combined deep learning with a set of rule-based approaches to enhance aspect extraction and sentiment scoring methods [Source 9](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/j.aci.2019.02.002/full/html). This hybrid approach can leverage the strengths of both methods to achieve better results.

Another approach is to use rule-based machine learning (RBML), which identifies, learns, or evolves rules to store, manipulate, or apply knowledge [Source 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_machine_learning). RBML is different from traditional rule-based systems, as it applies learning algorithms to automatically identify useful rules instead of relying on hand-crafted rules. This approach can be beneficial when you want to adapt to changing trends and have more flexibility in tweaking parameters.

Relearning can be applied in both rule-based and machine learning approaches. In rule-based systems, relearning can involve updating the rule set based on new information or changing conditions. In machine learning, relearning can involve retraining the model with new data to improve its accuracy and adaptability.

Here are the pros and cons of each approach:

~~~
1. **Combining rule-based systems and machine learning**
   - Pros:
     - Can leverage the strengths of both methods.
     - Can improve performance in specific tasks.
   - Cons:
     - May require more complex implementation.
     - May require more resources for training and maintenance.

2. **Rule-based machine learning**
   - Pros:
     - Can adapt to changing trends and have more flexibility in parameter tweaking.
     - Can automatically identify useful rules.
   - Cons:
     - May require more computational resources for learning algorithms.
     - May be more complex to implement compared to traditional rule-based systems.

In conclusion, blending rule-based systems, implied programming, and machine learning can be achieved through different approaches, each with its own set of trade-offs. The choice of approach depends on factors such as the complexity of the task, the volume of data, and the desired level of adaptability.
