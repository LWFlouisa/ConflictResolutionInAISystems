## Misapplied Unlearning And The Future Of Soft Unlearning
It seems that you are looking for ways to fix issues like misalignment from misapplied unlearning and restricting access to certain functionalities based on user roles. Based on the provided context, I will discuss some relevant techniques and their trade-offs.

**Coded Machine Unlearning**

Coded machine unlearning is a technique that can help in removing traces of a sample from a system [Source 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15721). The paper proposes a coded learning protocol that utilizes linear encoders to encode the training data into shards before the learning phase. This unlearning protocol satisfies the perfect unlearning criterion, providing a better performance versus unlearning cost trade-off compared to the uncoded baseline.

Pros:
- Better performance vs. unlearning cost trade-off
- Utilizes linear encoders for encoding data into shards

Cons:
- Requires a more complex encoding and decoding process
- May not be directly applicable to all types of misalignment issues

**SISA Training**

SISA training is a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure [Source 5](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/machine-unlearning). It is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. SISA training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set.

Pros:
- Reduces computational overhead associated with unlearning
- Improves time to unlearn points for various tasks

Cons:
- May not be applicable to all types of misalignment issues
- Requires careful consideration of data point influence in the training procedure

**Access Control**

For restricting access to certain functionalities based on user roles, you can implement an access control mechanism. This can be achieved by using role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. These models help in managing user permissions and controlling access to resources based on user roles and attributes.

Pros:
- Provides granular control over resource access
- Allows for easy management of user permissions

Cons:
- Requires careful planning and implementation of access control models
- May require additional overhead for maintaining user roles and attributes

In summary, you can use techniques like coded machine unlearning and SISA training to address misalignment issues. Additionally, implementing an access control mechanism can help in restricting access to certain functionalities based on user roles. Each approach has its pros and cons, so it's essential to carefully consider the specific requirements of your system before choosing the most suitable solution.
